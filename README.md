# DragNDropz Integration

A fully functional sample showing how to integrate DragNDropz (https://dragndropz.com) image and file upload widgets to be used in any application.  

DragNDropz can integrate with any web application, page, or platform for free.  You can embed and use our drag and drop service making it easy for your users to upload files, images, photos, and more.  Capture the results of file and photo uploads, receive information about the files uploaded (including direct image and file links), and use the returned data as desired (even store them in your own database).  Each unique user can upload up to 5 images and up to 5 files per day for free.  Pro users can login to their account via the embedded iframe and upload as many files and photos as they want.  DragNDropz integration is powerful, quick, and easy.  And best of all, you don't have to worry about handling file or image uploads.  Let our service do the work for you.
